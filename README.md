# Derek's Graph Visualizer

Welcome to my graph algorithm visualizer! On this application, you can visualizer the shortest path between the start and end nodes using some of the most popular pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, A\*, and Swarm. I also included some extra functionalities, like making walls, adding bombs, and adding weights. When opening this app, there is a short tutorial that will walk you through the basics of the application. I hope that you have as much fun visualizing as I did making this applicaiton and learning about the fascinating world of graph algorithms. As always, feel free to browse this app and others that I have made on my github or on my website: https://dxu5.github.io/website/ Thank you so much!
